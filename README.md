# Simple Next.js TypeScript starter

Sometimes I just need to test things out without too much boilerplate and still have the flexibility to use good stuffs. That's why I created this repo. This is a simple _Next.js_ and _TypeScript_ starter. There's a support for [Tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss), and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Configured [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (my favorite state management library) with immer.

## Getting started

This project is using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), so instead of using npm/yarn it is encouraged to install dependencies using pnpm. If you don't have pnpm installed on your machine you can [follow the instructions at pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/installation) to get it up and running for your machine. To run the project you need to do the following:

1. Start by running the `pnpm install` command to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `pnpm run dev` to run the development server or `pnpm run build` to build the project for deploying.
